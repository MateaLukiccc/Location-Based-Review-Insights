The fortress's historical significance and well-preserved medieval architecture are also consistently highlighted, contributing to a deeper sense of cultural immersion. Despite the physical difficulty, the hike is perceived as a rewarding adventure, with many noting that even those not in peak physical condition can manage it with breaks. Travelers appreciate the flexibility of multiple access routes, including free scenic alternatives that offer a quieter, more natural path. Early morning or evening visits are favored for cooler temperatures and optimal lighting, especially at sunset. Additional conveniences like water and drinks sold by local vendors along the route are valued, especially during hot weather.
